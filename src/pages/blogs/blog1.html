        My Journey Into Software Development
      </h1>

      <p class="">
        Software development wasn’t always in my plans. In fact, like many, I
        stumbled into it rather unexpectedly. Looking back now, I realize that
        the path to becoming a developer was full of challenges, learning, and
        a deepening passion for technology that I could not have anticipated.
      </p>

      <h2 class="uppercase font-bold py-4">The First Encounter</h2>
      <p>
        My first brush with programming happened during college. I wasn't
        studying computer science or anything related to technology, but there
        was an elective course in basic web development that caught my eye. I
        thought, <em>Why not?</em> I figured it would be a useful skill to
        pick up. Little did I know, that simple choice would set me on an
        entirely different path.
      </p>

      <p>
        It started small—HTML, CSS, and a sprinkle of JavaScript. I built a
        basic website that, in retrospect, was quite ugly. But the sense of
        accomplishment from writing code and seeing it come to life on a
        browser was exhilarating. I was hooked.
      </p>

      <h2 class="uppercase font-bold py-4">The Growth of a Passion</h2>
      <p>
        Once the course ended, I found myself wanting to learn more. I started
        teaching myself through online tutorials, watching YouTube videos, and
        experimenting with small projects. I dabbled in various languages,
        from Python to Java, exploring different aspects of software
        development to see where my passion truly lay.
      </p>

      <h2 class="uppercase font-bold py-4">Facing the Challenges</h2>
      <p>
        Of course, the journey wasn’t all smooth sailing. There were countless
        late nights, moments of frustration, and plenty of times when nothing
        seemed to work. Debugging could feel like chasing ghosts, and
        understanding complex concepts often felt like trying to solve a
        riddle with no answer key.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the biggest challenges was imposter syndrome. Even as I grew
        more competent in coding, there were moments when I doubted myself,
        when I questioned if I was good enough to call myself a developer. But
        I learned that the feeling was normal, and the key to overcoming it
        was persistence and patience. Every hurdle I faced taught me something
        new, and each solved problem bolstered my confidence.
      </p>

      <h2 class="uppercase font-bold py-4">Tailoring My Skills</h2>
      <p>
        As I delved deeper, I began to gravitate toward specific areas of
        development. I discovered that I had a particular interest in
        front-end design. The blend of logic and creativity appealed to me,
        and I enjoyed working with technologies like HTML, CSS (eventually
        Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript to create clean, responsive, and
        intuitive user interfaces. Tailoring websites to be functional,
        beautiful, and efficient became a passion.
      </p>

      <h2 class="uppercase font-bold py-4">Building Projects</h2>
      <p>
        Soon enough, I started working on my own projects. From simple
        portfolio websites to more complex web applications, each project
        became a stepping stone, pushing my limits and expanding my
        understanding of development. Along the way, I learned about
        frameworks like React, version control with Git, and even dabbled in
        back-end technologies.
      </p>

      <h2 class="uppercase font-bold py-4">The Road Ahead</h2>
      <p>
        Now, as I reflect on my journey into software development, I realize
        that this is just the beginning. There is still so much to learn and
        countless new challenges to face, but that’s what excites me. Software
        development isn’t a destination but a continuous journey of growth,
        problem-solving, and creativity.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through this journey, I’ve learned that becoming a developer isn’t
        just about mastering a programming language or framework—it’s about
        developing a mindset of curiosity, persistence, and adaptability. It's
        about embracing the unknown and finding joy in the process of
        learning.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am grateful for where I started, excited for where I am, and eager
        to see where this journey will take me next.
